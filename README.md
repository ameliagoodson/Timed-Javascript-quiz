# Timed Javascript quiz

This application is a short, timed quiz. It was coded by manipulating the DOM to produce dynamic content, such as the content of the questions.

When the user clicks the start button, a new screen appears with the first question and a timer appears. Upon clicking on the answer to the question via the dynamic buttons, the user will be presented with the second question, and so on, until the third and final question is answered.

When the user clicks on the third answer, the will be presented with a new screen advising them to enter their initials, into the input field and submit. If the user finishes before the timer expires, the timer will be paused. If the user does not finish before the timer expires, they will be presented with a message saying 'time's up!'
